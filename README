It turned out that writing a text editor is even more boring than I thought...

qawno has:

- Basic editing like open/save a file, cut/copy/paste code, etc (Find is broken)
- Pawn syntax highlighting
- In-place compiling (just press F5)
- Shows compiler output in a docked window (unlike pawno)
